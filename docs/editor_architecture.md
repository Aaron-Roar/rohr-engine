# Editor architecture

The editor is a separate executable under `tools/editor`. It links Rohr Engine
and uses the engine's graphics, input, and primitive UI systems, but its authoring
model is intentionally separate from runtime ECS entities.

```

Editor ids are stable references inside editor data. They are not engine
`Entity` handles and are never serialized as live ECS state. Generated C creates
fresh runtime entities and returns them through a generated typed object whose
fields hold the resulting handles.

## Modules

`tools/editor/src/main.c`
: Owns application lifetime and coordinates extracted states, item editors,
  viewport controls, menus, browser code, and panels.

`editor_project.h` and `editor_project.c`
: Define and mutate the in-memory authoring model. This layer owns stable editor
  ids, defaults, naming rules, topology changes, derived particle fitting, and
  editor-time joint constraints. It does not allocate engine entities.

`editor_project_json.c`
: Serializes and validates the editor project. Missing fields with defined
  defaults support loading older project files. `EDITOR_PROJECT_FORMAT_VERSION`
  identifies incompatible schema changes.

`editor_workspace.h` and `editor_workspace.c`
: Own project-directory creation, manifest loading/saving, starter content,
  CMake scaffolding, and C generation. Generation writes only configured
  generated paths; developer-owned `main.c` is written only during initial
  project creation.

`editor_viewport.h` and `editor_viewport.c`
: Own camera transforms, drawing, hit testing, selection, dragging, editor-mode
  transitions, and keyboard nudging. World-to-screen conversion also performs
  the engine/editor Y-axis inversion.

`browser/editor_file_browser.h` and `browser/editor_file_browser.c`
: Implement the modal directory browser and its two-pane directory preview.

`editor_layout.h`
: Shares the current logical viewport/tool-column dimensions.

## State separation

Three states are deliberately distinct:

- `EditorProject` is persistent authored content.
- `EditorViewportState` is transient navigation, selection, camera, and drag state.
- `EditorWorkspace` is persistent project configuration plus the currently open path.

Viewport selection ids refer into `EditorProject`, but selection and camera data
are not the source of authored geometry. UI labels and field assets are render
resources owned by `main.c` and are destroyed when the editor exits.

## Input and hit priority

The UI frame consumes pointer input before the viewport. Unconsumed viewport
input is transformed from screen space to authored world space and resolved in
mode-specific priority order. Handles such as origins, rotation controls,
vertices, and lines take priority over parent-body interiors.

Editor modes are explicit (`EDITOR_VIEWPORT_RIGID_BODY`,
`EDITOR_VIEWPORT_HITBOX`, `EDITOR_VIEWPORT_PARTICLE`, and others). A click may
change selection without changing mode; a double-click or `Enter` normally opens
the selected item's mode. `Escape` moves to the parent mode.

This mode-aware priority is important. For example, the owning particle ring is
ignored in hitbox mode so it cannot steal vertex editing, while another body's
particle ring remains selectable.

## UI composition

Editor widgets are composed from Rohr UI primitives: interactions, surfaces,
borders, labels, fields, sliders, dropdowns, and scroll regions. Bounds are
resolved by the active scroll region so drawing, clipping, navigation, and hit
testing use the same coordinates.

Custom editor visuals should also be built from scroll-aware primitives. Direct
screen drawing inside a scrolling panel can visually separate an icon from its
interaction bounds.

The tools column is one scroll region. Its content height determines the final
delete-row position. Modal dropdowns and the file browser temporarily capture
navigation so arrow keys cannot move unrelated column controls.

## Persistence and generation

Saving follows this path:

```text
EditorProject -> objects/project.rohr.json
EditorWorkspaceConfig -> project.rohr.json
```

Generating follows a separate path:

```text
EditorProject -> src/generated/project_objects.h
              -> src/generated/project_objects.c
```

Generated creation is transactional: if a component or entity operation fails,
already-created runtime entities are destroyed. Generated destruction tolerates
partially created objects and clears handles afterward.

Particle geometry is stored independently from the first rigid-body hitbox.
Its origin is local to the rigid-body origin; auto-fit derives radius from that
origin and the farthest hitbox vertex. JSON and generated C preserve polygon,
particle origin, and particle radius separately.

## Ownership rules

- `EditorProject` owns dynamically growing editor collections and their names.
- Parent removal owns removal of its children.
- Anchors are independent object children and are referenced by joints.
- Joints do not own anchors and therefore do not implicitly delete them.
- Soft bodies currently own nodes and beams. Beam-derived areas have been
  removed; visual area authoring is unavailable until node-loop areas land.
- Generated source owns no editor data; it materializes runtime entities only.

## Node-loop geometry foundation

`src/math/node_loop_geometry.h` provides the internal, allocation-free geometry
foundation for forthcoming soft-body areas. It has no entity or beam dependencies
and is not an installed public API. Runtime areas and editor area authoring are
still unavailable at this milestone stage.

`node_loop_triangulation_get` validates an ordered loop of 3 to
`NODE_LOOP_MAX_POINTS` points (currently the shared 100-vertex geometry limit).
The final edge connects back to the first point implicitly. Convex and concave
loops work in either winding; straight boundary subdivisions retain their nodes.
Nonfinite or repeated points, backtracking, zero-area loops, and nonadjacent
edges that cross, touch, or overlap are rejected. Calculations use doubles and
relative error bounds for numerically indistinguishable collinearity.

The caller owns the returned fixed triangle indices into the supplied node order.
Failure leaves its previous triangulation intact. Creation uses deterministic
ear clipping with bounded scratch storage; triangulate only for authoring edits.
`node_loop_triangle_get` resolves a stored triangle against current positions in
that same node order. It accepts later folds, inversions, and collapses without
rediscovering boundaries or changing connectivity. Future runtime and editor
integration must preserve that order and retain the authored reference pose for
serialization; node-handle ownership validation belongs to those integrations.

## Extending the editor

When adding an authored property:

1. Add it to the appropriate editor model with a safe default.
2. Persist it in JSON while preserving a default for older files.
3. Add UI without mixing transient selection into persistent data.
4. Update viewport preview and hit testing if the property is visual.
5. Update generated C if it affects runtime behavior.
6. Extend `editor_project_test` with round-trip and generated-output checks.

Keep editor-only concepts out of the public engine API unless a game can use the
same concept independently of the editor.

# Notification architecture

Editor notifications are divided into a shared system and producer modules.
The notification panel and store own bounded history, the three-toast queue,
selection, scrolling, and detailed-report presentation. Layout dimensions live
in `editor_notification_layout.h` so toast and log geometry remain consistent.

Producer modules own domain-specific wording and details. Build configuration,
C generation, configure, and compile notifications are all produced by the
build-notification module. Future engine-runtime warning modules should publish
through the same notification system; they must not manipulate toast, log, or
modal state directly. Notifications are for recoverable information and
warnings, not substitutes for handling critical engine errors.

The left workspace reserves a shared 28-pixel action bar directly against the
bottom window edge. The viewport and the optional terminal both end at the
bar's top edge. Notification Log occupies the first slot; future persistent
actions may be placed beside it without covering terminal output or viewport
interaction.
