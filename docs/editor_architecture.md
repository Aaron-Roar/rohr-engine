# Editor architecture

The editor is a separate executable under `tools/editor`. It links Rohr Engine
and uses the engine's graphics, input, and primitive UI systems, but its authoring
model is intentionally separate from runtime ECS entities.

```

Editor ids are stable references inside editor data. They are not engine
`Entity` handles and are never serialized as live ECS state. Generated C creates
fresh runtime entities and returns them through a generated typed object whose
fields hold the resulting handles.

## Modules

`tools/editor/src/main.c`
: Owns application lifetime and coordinates extracted states, item editors,
  viewport controls, menus, browser code, and panels.

`editor_project.h` and `editor_project.c`
: Define and mutate the in-memory authoring model. This layer owns stable editor
  ids, defaults, naming rules, topology changes, derived particle fitting, and
  editor-time joint constraints. It does not allocate engine entities.

`editor_project_json.c`
: Serializes and validates the editor project. Missing fields with defined
  defaults support loading older project files. `EDITOR_PROJECT_FORMAT_VERSION`
  identifies incompatible schema changes.

`editor_workspace.h` and `editor_workspace.c`
: Own project-directory creation, manifest loading/saving, starter content,
  CMake scaffolding, and C generation. Generation writes only configured
  generated paths; developer-owned `main.c` is written only during initial
  project creation.

`editor_viewport.h` and `editor_viewport.c`
: Own camera transforms, drawing, hit testing, selection, dragging, editor-mode
  transitions, and keyboard nudging. World-to-screen conversion also performs
  the engine/editor Y-axis inversion.

`browser/editor_file_browser.h` and `browser/editor_file_browser.c`
: Implement the modal directory browser and its two-pane directory preview.

`editor_layout.h`
: Shares the current logical viewport/tool-column dimensions.

## State separation

Three states are deliberately distinct:

- `EditorProject` is persistent authored content.
- `EditorViewportState` is transient navigation, selection, camera, and drag state.
- `EditorWorkspace` is persistent project configuration plus the currently open path.

Viewport selection ids refer into `EditorProject`, but selection and camera data
are not the source of authored geometry. UI labels and field assets are render
resources owned by `main.c` and are destroyed when the editor exits.

## Input and hit priority

The UI frame consumes pointer input before the viewport. Unconsumed viewport
input is transformed from screen space to authored world space and resolved in
mode-specific priority order. Handles such as origins, rotation controls,
vertices, and lines take priority over parent-body interiors.

Editor modes are explicit (`EDITOR_VIEWPORT_RIGID_BODY`,
`EDITOR_VIEWPORT_HITBOX`, `EDITOR_VIEWPORT_PARTICLE`, and others). A click may
change selection without changing mode; a double-click or `Enter` normally opens
the selected item's mode. `Escape` moves to the parent mode.

This mode-aware priority is important. For example, the owning particle ring is
ignored in hitbox mode so it cannot steal vertex editing, while another body's
particle ring remains selectable.

## UI composition

Editor widgets are composed from Rohr UI primitives: interactions, surfaces,
borders, labels, fields, sliders, dropdowns, and scroll regions. Bounds are
resolved by the active scroll region so drawing, clipping, navigation, and hit
testing use the same coordinates.

Custom editor visuals should also be built from scroll-aware primitives. Direct
screen drawing inside a scrolling panel can visually separate an icon from its
interaction bounds.

The tools column is one scroll region. Its content height determines the final
delete-row position. Modal dropdowns and the file browser temporarily capture
navigation so arrow keys cannot move unrelated column controls.

## Persistence and generation

Saving follows this path:

```text
EditorProject -> objects/project.rohr.json
EditorWorkspaceConfig -> project.rohr.json
```

Generating follows a separate path:

```text
EditorProject -> src/generated/project_objects.h
              -> src/generated/project_objects.c
```

Generated creation is transactional: if a component or entity operation fails,
already-created runtime entities are destroyed. Generated destruction tolerates
partially created objects and clears handles afterward.

Particle geometry is stored independently from the first rigid-body hitbox.
Its origin is local to the rigid-body origin; auto-fit derives radius from that
origin and the farthest hitbox vertex. JSON and generated C preserve polygon,
particle origin, and particle radius separately.

## Ownership rules

- `EditorProject` owns dynamically growing editor collections and their names.
- Parent removal owns removal of its children.
- Anchors are independent object children and are referenced by joints.
- Joints do not own anchors and therefore do not implicitly delete them.
- Soft bodies own nodes, beams, and ordered visual areas. Areas own their
  outer node loop, up to 16 hole loops, appearance, and derived fill caches.
  Deleting a referenced node removes its dependent areas. Copies and history
  snapshots own independent caches; holes have stable IDs scoped to their area.
- Generated source owns no editor data; it materializes runtime entities only.

## Node-loop areas

`src/math/node_loop_geometry.h` builds current bounded loop regions independently
of physics, beams, and entity ownership. The outer loop is additive; up to 16
owned holes subtract from it. Each loop supports up to 64 points, with implicit
closure, either winding, and self-intersections. Overlapping holes subtract
only from their own area. No authored triangles or reference poses are stored.

Callers own the reusable workspace and triangle output. A failed build preserves
the previous output. Runtime and editor caches rebuild when loop membership or
current node positions change. Editor scene rendering, camera previews, picking,
and generated runtime rendering therefore use the same geometric rule.

`editor_soft_area.c` in editor core validates owner-local node IDs and provides
transactional loop edits, area order, and draft support. Shared commands route
GUI and CLI changes through history. Draft loops persist, but any incomplete
outer or hole loop suppresses the whole area fill and blocks generation before
files are replaced. Picking mode belongs to transient viewport state; saved
navigation records the area and hole IDs without reactivating picking on load.

The soft-body editor owns the Areas accordion and area/hole panel text assets.
Its font is borrowed from the existing editor font owner. Numbered loop rows
edit membership, while area hierarchy rows use the shared context menu and drag
reordering paths. Reordering areas changes drawing order without changing IDs.

## Extending the editor

When adding an authored property:

1. Add it to the appropriate editor model with a safe default.
2. Persist it in JSON while preserving a default for older files.
3. Add UI without mixing transient selection into persistent data.
4. Update viewport preview and hit testing if the property is visual.
5. Update generated C if it affects runtime behavior.
6. Extend `editor_project_test` with round-trip and generated-output checks.

Keep editor-only concepts out of the public engine API unless a game can use the
same concept independently of the editor.

# Notification architecture

Editor notifications are divided into a shared system and producer modules.
The notification panel and store own bounded history, the three-toast queue,
selection, scrolling, and detailed-report presentation. Layout dimensions live
in `editor_notification_layout.h` so toast and log geometry remain consistent.

Producer modules own domain-specific wording and details. Build configuration,
C generation, configure, and compile notifications are all produced by the
build-notification module. Future engine-runtime warning modules should publish
through the same notification system; they must not manipulate toast, log, or
modal state directly. Notifications are for recoverable information and
warnings, not substitutes for handling critical engine errors.

The left workspace reserves a shared 28-pixel action bar directly against the
bottom window edge. The viewport and the optional terminal both end at the
bar's top edge. Notification Log occupies the first slot; future persistent
actions may be placed beside it without covering terminal output or viewport
interaction.
